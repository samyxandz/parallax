# Parallax DSL

Parallax is a domain-specific language designed for high-performance computing with a focus on SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) operations, memory management, and optimizations. This document provides an overview of the project structure.

## Project Structure

The Parallax project is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose:

### `/src`

- **`/compiler`**: Contains the core compiler code for lexical analysis, parsing, and code generation. This is where the language syntax is processed and transformed into executable code.
  
- **`/simd`**: Includes implementations of SIMD-specific primitives and vectorized instructions. This directory focuses on low-level operations that leverage SIMD capabilities.

- **`/memory_management`**: Manages the garbage collector or ownership/borrowing system. This ensures efficient memory usage and prevents leaks.

- **`/optimizations`**: Handles various optimization passes such as constant folding, auto-vectorization, and other performance enhancements.

- **`/ffi`**: Implements the Foreign Function Interface (FFI) for calling C libraries or system APIs. This allows Parallax code to interact with external libraries and system functions.

### `/docs`

- **`/specs`**: Contains detailed specifications for language features, optimizations, and SIMD operations. This documentation describes the technical aspects and design choices of the language.

- **`/tutorials`**: Provides documentation and guides for developers using Parallax. Includes how-to guides, best practices, and examples to help users get started.

### `/tests`

- **`/unit_tests`**: Tests for individual language features such as parsing, optimizations, and SIMD instruction handling. Ensures that each component of the language functions correctly.

- **`/simd_tests`**: Specific tests for vectorized operations and performance benchmarks. Focuses on validating the correctness and performance of SIMD-related features.

### `/examples`

- **`/examples`**: Contains example code written in Parallax. Demonstrates the use of SIMD primitives, vectorized operations, and low-level parallelism. Provides practical usage scenarios for the language features.

### `/build`

- **`/build`**: Includes build scripts or configuration files for compiling the Parallax language. This may include CMake files, makefiles, or other build-related configurations.
